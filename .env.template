##############################################

# 1. GET STORE DOMAIN:
#    - Go to your Shopify Admin dashboard
#    - Navigate to Settings > General
#    - Copy your "Store address" (ends with .myshopify.com)

# 2. GET STOREFRONT ACCESS TOKEN:
#    OPTION A (Recommended - Private Apps):
#    - Go to Settings > Apps and sales channels
#    - Click "Develop apps"
#    - Click "Create an app"
#    - Name your app (e.g., "My Storefront")
#    - Go to "Configuration" tab
#    - Under "Storefront API access scopes", select:
#      * unauthenticated_read_product_listings
#      * unauthenticated_read_products
#      * unauthenticated_read_checkouts
#      * unauthenticated_write_checkouts
#    - Click "Save"
#    - Go to "API credentials" tab
#    - Copy the "Storefront access token"

#    OPTION B (Legacy - Private Apps):
#    - Go to Apps > Manage private apps
#    - Click "Create private app"
#    - Fill in app details
#    - Enable "Allow this app to access your storefront data"
#    - Select required permissions (same as above)
#    - Click "Save"
#    - Copy the "Storefront access token"

# 3. SECURITY NOTES:
#    - The Storefront Access Token is PUBLIC and safe to use in frontend code
#    - Never commit your .env.local file to version control
#    - The .env.local file should contain your real tokens (this template doesn't)
