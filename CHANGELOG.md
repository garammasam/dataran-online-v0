## Technical Summary

### Integration Approach
- **Hybrid Model**: Shopify Storefront API integration with static product fallback
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router (existing architecture preserved)
- **API Client**: Official Shopify Storefront API client
- **Authentication**: Shopify CLI login flow for deployment

### Key Features Added
1. **Dynamic Product Loading**: Async fetching from Shopify with caching
2. **Direct Checkout**: Seamless redirect to Shopify checkout
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: Static products when Shopify not configured
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and recovery
5. **Loading States**: User feedback during async operations
6. **Environment Configuration**: Template-based setup system

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Falls back to static data for immediate testing
- **Production**: Requires Shopify configuration for live functionality
- **Hosting**: Prepared for Shopify Oxygen deployment

### Security Implementation
- Public Storefront API tokens (safe for frontend)
- No private keys or sensitive data in codebase
- Environment variable template for secure configuration
- .env.local excluded from version control

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- None. Existing functionality preserved with progressive enhancement

### Dependencies Added
- `@shopify/storefront-api-client`: Official Shopify client
- `graphql`: Required for GraphQL queries

### Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN`: Store domain
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Public API token
- Optional: API version, currency, test mode flags

## Testing Status
- ✅ Development server starts successfully
- ✅ Static product display works (fallback mode)
- ✅ Product pages load correctly
- ✅ Add to cart functionality works
- ✅ Responsive design maintained
- ✅ No console errors in normal operation
- ✅ Graceful error handling implemented

## Next Steps for Deployment
1. Configure Shopify store credentials in `.env.local`
2. Test with real Shopify products
3. Deploy to Shopify Oxygen using `shopify hydrogen deploy`
4. Set up production environment variables
5. Test checkout flow with real payment methods
